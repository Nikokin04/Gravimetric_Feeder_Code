# Gravimetric_Feeder_Code
‚öñÔ∏è Gravimetric Dosing System with Arduino Mega
This project contains the code for a gravimetric dosing machine built with an Arduino Mega, designed to accurately dispense materials by weight using a load cell and HX711 amplifier. The system features an intuitive Nextion touchscreen interface, a foot pedal trigger, and a motorized dosing mechanism.

‚öôÔ∏è Features:
- Precise weight measurement using a load cell and HX711.
- Touchscreen UI on Nextion display for setting target weight, calibration, and monitoring.
- Pedal-controlled dispensing for hands-free operation.
- Motor control to start/stop material dosing based on real-time weight feedback.
- Tare function, calibration routine, and real-time display of current weight.

üîß Hardware:
- Microcontroller: Arduino Mega 2560.
- Weight Sensor: Load Cell + HX711.
- User Interface: Nextion TFT Touchscreen 7".
- Actuation: DC motor.
- Trigger: Foot pedal (digital input).
- PCB: Custom-designed by me.
